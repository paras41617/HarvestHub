<p align="justify">Wheat the most staple crop of human origin has been in food habits of general population since centuries. We all consume it for our daily requirements of nutrients and fulfill our need to enhance the energy level. We can’t even think of our food without this important crop.It's been ages that we have been consuming it and seen many changes which have to lead to its improvement and enhancement not only in terms of quantity but quality also. A number of researches are being gone on worldwide to enhance the production of wheat.</p>
<h3>Best Varieties of Wheat for Rabi Season</h3>
<h3>1. Hi 8759 (Puja Tejas)</h3>
<p>One of the varieties of wheat has a high level of rust resistance. It is a high yielding durum wheat variety with an average yield of >5.7t/ha and potential yield of 7.6t/ha, was released for timely sown irrigated conditions of Central Zone (CZ) by the Central Sub- Committee on Crop Standards, Notification and Release of Varieties for Agricultural Crops.</p>



<h3>2. HS 562</h3>
<p>This variety is known for having a good chapatti score (7.6) and bread-making qualities. It is also known for its micronutrient contents like iron (38.4ppm) and zinc (34.5ppm). It has a combination of rust resistance genes (Yr A+, Lr23, Sr8a+Sr8b) to combat rust pathogens.</p>

<h3>3. HD 3171</h3>
<p>The variety is mostly known for its resistance to yellow, brown and black rusts both under natural and artificial epiphytotic conditions during three years of testing. The resistance base in HD 3171 for yellow rust is postulated on the basis of the It'sunknown resistance gene, and for brown rust, it is based on the slow rusting gene, Lr 13 along with Lr 10.</p>

<h3>4. HD 1605 (Pusa Ujala)</h3>
<p>The variety is famous for its ability of resistance to black and brown rusts and also has a good level of resistance to flag smut, Karnal bunt, leaf blight, and foot rot diseases. It has excellent chapatti-making quality, good sedimentation value (-55 ml), high protein (-13%), and a high amount of micronutrients like iron (43 ppm) and zinc ( 35 ppm).</p>

<h2>Types of Maize Seed</h2>


<img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/the-corn-plant-in-the-field-picture-id1150439636?k=20&m=1150439636&s=612x612&w=0&h=-LEJKwoUWUUR_puGnrujT9O0J9l9NQ4_RA9q2uSiBoo="align="Right" height=640px width=650px>

<div class ="boxx">
<p>The six major types of maize are Pod corn, Dent Corn , Flint Corn , Popcorn , Flour Corn , and Sweet Corn .</p>

<h3>1. Pod Corn</h3>
<p>Pod corn or wild maize is a variety of maize.It is not a wild ancestor of maize but rather a mutant that forms leaves around each kernel.
Pod corn is not grown commercially, but it is preserved in some localities</p>

<h3>2. Dent Corn</h3>
<p>Dent corn, also known as grain corn, is a type of field corn with a high soft starch content. It received its name because of the small indentation, or "dent", at the crown of each kernel on a ripe ear of corn.</p>

<h3>3. Flint Corn</h3>
<p>Flint corn is a variant of maize, the same species as common corn.Because each kernel has a hard outer layer to protect the soft endosperm, it is likened to being hard as flint; hence the name.</p>

<h3>4. Pop Corn</h3>
<p>Popcorn is a variety of corn kernel which expands and puffs up when heated; the same names are also used to refer to the foodstuff produced by the expansion.</p>

<h3>5. Flour Corn</h3>
<p>Flour corn  is a variety of corn with a soft starchy endosperm and a thin pericarp.It is primarily used to make corn flour.</p>

<h3>6. Sweet Corn</h3>
<p>Sweet corn  is a variety of maize grown for human consumption with a high sugar content. Sweet corn is the result of a naturally occurring recessive mutation in the genes which control conversion of sugar to starch inside the endosperm of the corn kernel.</p>

<h2>Types of Rice Seed</h2>
</div>
<img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/ripe-rice-in-the-field-of-farmland-picture-id622925154?k=20&m=622925154&s=612x612&w=0&h=hLtkpC3VdXeqWhblSowvPRu4XgsCwFW6JQM-Px2KzbY=" alt="southsideplants.com" align="Right" height=636px width=650px>

<div class ="boxx">
<p>Rice is used widely in Asian and Indian cuisines, but it can be found in all kinds of dishes from around the world. Paella and curry rely on it heavily. You can’t make sushi without rice. Rice can really bring a burrito together, and jambalaya wouldn’t be the same without it.</p>



<h3>1. Arborio rice</h3>

<p>This your go-to rice for making any risotto dish. It retains more starch than some other types of rice, which releases when you cook it lends itself to creating creamy, yummy risotto. But once cooked, it will still have a slightly firm texture.</p>

<h3>2. Basmati rice</h3>

<p>This is a type of long-grain, Indian rice. You’ve probably had it in curry. It’s nutty and aromatic, sometimes compared to Jasmine rice for that reason. If you want to make your own pilaf, this is the rice you should turn to.</p>

<h3>3. Black rice</h3>

<p>It’s sometimes called the forbidden rice, though it’s not so forbidden these days, widely available at stores like Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, and even Walmart. It tastes earthy and nutty. It contains antioxidants known as anthocyanins, which is what turns it a dark color.</p>


<h3>4. Brown rice</h3>

<p>Brown rice is the new white rice. It can be easily substituted into any dish in the place of white rice and it contains more nutrients such as phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium, while also offering more fiber per serving than white rice.</p>


<h3>5. Wild rice</h3>

<p>Interestingly enough, wild isn’t actually rice. It just looks, cooks, and acts like rice so it gets to borrow the name. Wild rice is actually made of seeds that come from a type of marsh grass. It has more antioxidants than actual rice and may help improve heart health and lower the risk of diabetes [source]. Like long-grain white rice, it has a fluffy texture but tastes more rustic and earthy. The photo pictured above is a mixture of wild and brown rice.</p>

<div class=boxx>
<p>Millets come in different shapes and sizes. The two broad categories discussed above contain numerous kinds of millets. We will take a look at some of these different types below:</p>

<h3>1. Foxtail Millet</h3>
<p>Foxtail millet, or indigenously called Kakum/Kangni. It contains blood sugar balancing healthy carbohydrates. The iron and calcium content present in it also helps strengthen immunity. In addition, foxtail millets help regulate your blood cholesterol and increase HDL cholesterol levels in your body.</p>

<h3>2. Finger Millet/Ragi</h3>
<p>Ragi is a more common name for finger millet. It is used as a healthier cereal substitute for rice and wheat. Ragi is gluten-free and rich in protein. Ragi is supposed to aid brain development in growing children.</p>

<h3>3. Pearl Millet/Bajra</h3>
<p>Bajra is incredibly nutrient-dense. It contains minerals such as calcium and magnesium, protein, fibre, and iron. Practice regular consumption of pearl millet to fight against type II diabetes.</p>

<h3>4. Buckwheat</h3>
<p>Go for buckwheat if your primary concern is to lose weight. It makes for a healthy food option for diabetes, helps lower blood pressure, and improves cardiovascular health. Buckwheat also fights against diseases such as gallstones, childhood asthma, and breast cancer.</p>


<h3>5. Little Millet</h3>
<p>Little millet is also an excellent option for those looking to lose weight. You can eat it as a rice replacement. It is high in fibre and filled with numerous minerals such as potassium, zinc, iron, and calcium. It is also packed with the health benefits of vitamin B and works as an antioxidant for your body.</p>

                   <p>Nitrogen fertilizers are made from ammonia (NH3) produced by the Haber-Bosch process. In this energy-intensive process, natural gas (CH4) usually supplies the hydrogen, and the nitrogen (N2) is derived from the air. This ammonia is used as a feedstock for all other nitrogen fertilizers, such as anhydrous ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) and urea (CO(NH2)2).Deposits of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) (Chilean saltpeter) are also found in the Atacama desert in Chile and was one of the original (1830) nitrogen-rich fertilizers used.It is still mined for fertilizer. Nitrates are also produced from ammonia by the Ostwald process.</p>

                   <p>Phosphate fertilizers are obtained by extraction from phosphate rock, which contains two principal phosphorus-containing minerals, fluorapatite Ca5(PO4)3F (CFA) and hydroxyapatite Ca5(PO4)3OH. These minerals are converted into water-soluble phosphate salts by treatment with sulfuric (H2SO4) or phosphoric acids (H3PO4). The large production of sulfuric acid is primarily motivated by this application.In the nitrophosphate process or Odda process (invented in 1927), phosphate rock with up to a 20% phosphorus (P) content is dissolved with nitric acid (HNO3) to produce a mixture of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2). This mixture can be combined with a potassium fertilizer to produce a compound fertilizer with the three macronutrients N, P and K in easily dissolved form.</p>

                   <p>Potash is a mixture of potassium minerals used to make potassium (chemical symbol: K) fertilizers. Potash is soluble in water, so the main effort in producing this nutrient from the ore involves some purification steps; e.g., to remove sodium chloride (NaCl) (common salt). Sometimes potash is referred to as K2O, as a matter of convenience to those describing the potassium content. In fact, potash fertilizers are usually potassium chloride, potassium sulfate, potassium carbonate, or potassium nitrate.</p>

                   <p>“Organic fertilizers" can describe those fertilizers with an organic – biologic – origin—that is, fertilizers derived from living or formerly living materials. Organic fertilizers can also describe commercially available and frequently packaged products that strive to follow the expectations and restrictions adopted by “organic agriculture” and ”environmentally friendly" gardening – related systems of food and plant production that significantly limit or strictly avoid the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. The "organic fertilizer" products typically contain both some organic materials as well as acceptable additives such as nutritive rock powders, ground sea shells (crab, oyster, etc.), other prepared products such as seed meal or kelp, and cultivated microorganisms and derivatives.</p>
