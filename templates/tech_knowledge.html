                               <hr />
                                       The Sun has been worshiped as a life-giver to our planet since ancient times. The industrial ages gave us the understanding of sunlight as an energy source. India is endowed with vast solar energy potential. About 5,000 trillion kWh per year energy is incident over India's land area with most parts receiving 4-7 kWh per sq. m per day. Solar photovoltaics power can effectively be harnessed providing huge scalability in India. Solar also provides the ability to generate power on a distributed basis and enables rapid capacity addition with short lead times. Off-grid decentralized and low-temperature applications will be advantageous from a rural electrification perspective and meeting other energy needs for power and heating and cooling in both rural and urban areas. From an energy security perspective, solar is the most secure of all sources, since it is abundantly available. Theoretically, a small fraction of the total incident solar energy (if captured effectively) can meet the entire country's power requirements.

                    <h3>How Solar Energy Can Coincide With Crop and Animal Agriculture?</h3>
                        Solar power is becoming increasingly popular. Energy harvested from the sun provides
                        homes and businesses with clean power to meet their needs. Over time, solar panels
                        can drastically reduce costs. However, they take up quite a bit of space.
                        Researchers have found that plants will grow and produce below elevated solar panels,
                         and animals can still graze the land beneath the panels. Solar energy in agriculture has become possible,
                          and it has proven results. Plus, it allows another stream of income for farmers.

                  <div class="col" style="border-style: solid;">
                    <h3>The Beginnings of Agrivoltaics</h3>
                        The University of Massachusetts Crop Research and Education Center has been researching the
                         compatibility of agriculture with solar energy generation, also known as agrivoltaics, since 2008.
                         In 2010, construction company owner Dave Marley partnered with researchers from the university to
                         put 70 solar panels in place, elevated seven feet above farmland, with zero disruption to the soil.
                        Installers left enough space between the solar panels to allow sunlight to reach the plants below.
                        The solar panels remain, as both the agricultural and solar farmers have benefited from the dual-use solar installations
                  </div>
                </div>
                <br />
                <h3>Crops Yield Beneath Solar Panels</h3>
                Despite less sunlight reaching the crops beneath the solar installations, the crops still yield.
                 Foraging plants, like grasses, generated about 90% compared to the crops not covered by solar panels.
                The University of Massachusetts has also grown other plants besides grazing grasses,
                 such as peppers, tomatoes, beans and cilantro. When placing the solar panels with three- to four-foot gaps between them,
                 the vegetable plants produced almost the same amount as those not beneath the panels.
                Usually, turf or gravel is the foundation lying beneath solar installations,
                but growing plants creates a safe, friendly environment for pollinators.
                Other researchers in Minnesota have grown native plants under solar panels to encourage pollination.
                The pollinators can then do their job and pollinate crops. Without pollination, crops can’t grow, and the economy collapses.
                Although crop yields do not match the gains from full, open sunlight, the costs even out.
                The solar panels provide energy for farmers, which reduces production costs.
                Large farm equipment can't harvest crops grown under solar installations.
                Therefore, farmers must primarily harvest vegetables manually, so there are some limitations to what they can plant.
        
        <h3>Solar Energy in Agriculture</h3>
        Solar energy can coincide with crop and animal agriculture.
        The National Renewable Energy Laboratory has continued to fund other research efforts in states across the country.
         With continued research and application, the future of solar energy in agriculture
         looks rewarding for energy conservators and farmers alike.
         A growing number of farms and agricultural businesses are looking to solar to power their daily operations. Thanks in part to the Solar Energy Technologies Office's investments, the cost of going solar has declined, enabling more installations across the country. Consider these questions to help you determine what’s best for you and your farm.

                              One of the most important jobs of a farmer is to make sure that he uses the water he has
                              judiciously (especially if rain is not in the forecast). A new set of smartphone apps
                              called SmartIrrigation are aimed at helping cotton, strawberry and citrus farmers
                               manage the water they use on their crops by taking into account local weather conditions.
                               <br />
                               Smart irrigation systems can optimize water levels based on things such as
                               soil moisture and weather predictions. This is done with wireless moisture sensors that
                                communicate with the smart irrigation controls and help inform the system whether or not the landscape is in need of water.

                              The modern farm machinery has upgraded the agricultural industry for the best.
                              Some of the essential and most used machinery are Combine or Combine Harvester, Rotavator or Rotary Tiller,
                               Plough or Plow, Tractor Trailer, Power Harrow, Leveler, water bowser, ripper machine, and disc harrow.
                               mechanised agriculture includes the use of tractors, trucks, combine harvesters, countless types of farm implements,

                               By utilizing mechanical power in agriculture leads to reduce animal power so that raring of
                               animals is not required and utilization of fodder area can be used to grow crops for producing food for human consumption.

                                 related to the crop's chlorophyll content and biomass. It calculates the actual N-uptake of the crop.
                                 Optimum application rates are derived from the N-uptake data and sent to the controller of the variable
